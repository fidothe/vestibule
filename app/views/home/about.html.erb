  <%= page_title 'What is Vestibule?' %>

  <p>Vestibule is a tool to help us &mdash; the community &mdash; generate and prepare the contents of the day.</p>

  <p>The idea is simple. You propose a presentation. Others will help you refine and focus it by making <em>suggestions</em>. You keep updating your proposal bearing those suggestions in mind.</p>

  <p>At some point (yet to be determined), we&rsquo;ll then collectively whittle down the set of proposals to those that have been selected for the day.</p>

  <p>Vestibule was developed by the fine people behind <a href="http://rubymanor.org/">Ruby Manor</a>.</p>
